# Internet Service Provider App

## Overview
This app is designed to help internet service provider workers efficiently manage and monitor unpaid users, organize users by area, and record daily expenses. The app allows workers to track unpaid users who have not paid their monthly fees, search for users based on area, and add new users to the system. Additionally, it features a daily expense tracking system for items or equipment purchased.

## Features
- **Check Unpaid Users**: Workers can easily view a list of users who haven't paid their monthly fees.

- **Track Daily Expenses**: A feature for workers to log daily expenses for equipment or other purchases, helping keep track of operational costs.

## How it Works
